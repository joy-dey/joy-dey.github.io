<h1>About Me!</h1>
<h3>SO, I AM FROM 21st CENTURY.  WITH QUITE A STORY TO TELL…</h3>
<div class="section" id="info">
<p>Hello, I'm Joy! I've always been a follow-your-heart-kind-of-boy. When I decided to pursue Diploma in Computer Science, I didn't exactly know where the journey would take me. A few years later, I still can't believe that I'm living out this dream. I currently live in Agartala with my sweet family. We have dreams of adventure and living abroad. My happiness comes from slow mornings and foggy days by the green fields. I am inspired by light, music, travel, and vulnerability. When I'm not exploring the city, you can find me wandering around this beautiful world of ours. My work is personal. While it's a collection of different moments, light, and feeling -- you'll find bits and pieces of my heart as well.
<br>
<br>
I am a Developer. I love creating stuff not to satisfy but to delight. Because my work is personal, the best works are created when the connection between us goes beyond just needing a Developer for your website/application. I've learned over the years that while you might like my work, that sometimes isn’t enough. This is a collaboration.
<br>
<br>
I enjoy working with people who trust me as a Developer....an observer with his own vision. If that resonates with you, I think we're on the same page and I'd love to hear from you.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Thanks for being here!</h2>
